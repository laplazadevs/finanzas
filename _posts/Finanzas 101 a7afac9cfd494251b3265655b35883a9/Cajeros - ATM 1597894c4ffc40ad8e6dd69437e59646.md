You will usually be offered the opportunity to be charged in either Colombian pesos or in your home currency. ALWAYS accept Colombian pesos, you will get a MUCH better exchange rate. As an example on a withdrawal of approximately 900,000 COP, by accepting to be charged in GBP, the cost would have been an extra GBP 5.00.
